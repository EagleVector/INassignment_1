Q1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
    integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

* is an expression
'hello' is a value
-87.8 is a value
- is an expression
/ is an expression
+ is an expression
6 is a valueQ2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans. String is a data type which can be any combination of numerical,characters or special characters.In python,its mandatory that A string must always be enclosed inside the upper quotes ' ' or " ".

Variables can be defined as a storage points inside RAM which contain data of any data type. A keyword can not be a variable.Q3. Describe three different data types.
Ans. int : It consists of an integer data type.Only numeric integers can be stored inside this data type. Eg. 23,3,506,7789,9000

float: It consists of decimal type numerical values.Eg. 23.0098 , 89.007 , 7.0

string: It consist of any alphanumeric values and also special characters. Eg. 'shubham1996' , 'abc@xyzgmail.com'Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans. Expressions are meant to perform all the useful mathematical operations. Eg. +,-,*,/,%,**,<,>,==,!=
+ : addition
- : substraction
* : multiplication
/ : divison
% : remainder
** : raised to the power
< : less than
> : greater than
== : equal to
!= : not equal toQ5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
Ans. spam = 10 is an assignment operator which assigns an integer value 10 to the variable spam and stores in the memory. Expressions on the other hand returns a value after evaluating it.Q6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans. bacon will be incremented by a value 1. It will return 23Q7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam' will return 'spamspamspam' [Its a concatenation operation]
'spam' * 3 will return 'spamspamspam' 
Ans. Both will return the same output8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans. An integer cannot be a variable while eggs can be a valid variable name as it is not a keyword.9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans. We can perform typecasting operation to perform the conversion of data type.
# In[18]:


int(65.67)


# In[13]:


float(76)


# In[14]:


str(78)


# In[16]:


str('imran@56')

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'
Ans. Concatenation can only be performed on string data type.
# In[21]:


'I have eaten' + ' 99 ' + 'burritos'


# In[22]:


pwd()


# In[23]:


cd /Users/shubhamkumar/Downloads
